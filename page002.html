<h1>My Life in Technology</h1>
<p "style=font-size:17px;">
Clearly, mobile phones that are now considered a demonstration of civilization are the most powerful piece of technology in our lives today. Because of the many changes in the technological environment, technology dependence is rising every day. There are advances to a very rapid degree to the extent that they are self-defeating at one stage. The ability to convert carbon dioxide to fuel is a big development, and as soon as it is well known, it will continuously change the way it relies on restricted and non-renewable sources. More than 700 million people from around the world are literally connected through the internet. The technology is certainly state-of-the-art and has helped to boost our communications and education quality considerably.
